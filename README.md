# DEPRECATED
This bot is deprecated. Please use the complete rewrite listed [here](https://github.com/sriRacha21/Rutgers-kun3).

# Rutgers Esports Discord Bot
This is the Bitbucket/Github Repository for the Rutgers Esports Discord Bot, whose rewrite is done!

### WHAT DO I DO?
Rutgers Esports Discord bot is a bot specially made for Rutgers Esports Discord. It has the ability to:

- Add, remove, list roles

- Lets mods and admins mute users

- Automutes users for mentioning certain roles

- Word filter

- Track edits and deletes for messages

- Keeps track of "chains" of the same messages

- Run code snippets in a sandboxed environment

- 2-step email verification for Rutgers Students

- Check understanding of rules by users through `!agree` before letting them into server.

### TODO LIST FOR V2.1
- [x] bugfixes involving warn and quote
- [ ] dm warnings as richembeds, display warnings as richembeds
- [ ] clear warnings
- [ ] configurable channels for #audit, #approval, #votes, #botcommands
- [ ] relate synonyms to command so settings in database with a command turned off also turn off synonyms

### SERVER MODIFICATIONS THAT MUST BE MADE IN AN UNMANAGED SERVER
None! Bot should work right out of the box.

### LINK
This link allows the user account that owns the bot to add it to another server:
[ will be updated soon ]

### KNOWN BUGS
1. Upon counting chains greater than or equal to 10, the bot sometimes reacts with the digits out of order.
