 *   Sample rate in Hertz of the audio data sent in all

 *   16000 is optimal. For best results, set the sampling rate of the audio
 *   source to 16000 Hz. If that's not possible, use the native sample rate of

 *   This field is optional for `FLAC` and `WAV` audio files and required

 *
 * @property {boolean} enableSeparateRecognitionPerChannel
 *   This needs to be set to `true` explicitly and `audio_channel_count` > 1
 *   to get each channel recognized separately. The recognition result will
 *   contain a `channel_tag` field to state which channel that result belongs
 *   to. If this is not true, we will only recognize the first channel. The

 *   Specifically, the maximum number of `SpeechRecognitionAlternative` messages
 *   within each `SpeechRecognitionResult`.
 *   The server may return fewer than `max_alternatives`.
 *   Valid values are `0`-`30`. A value of `0` or `1` will return a maximum of

 *   *Optional* If set to `true`, the server will attempt to filter out
 *   profanities, replacing all but the initial character in each filtered word
 *   with asterisks, e.g. "f***". If set to `false` or omitted, profanities
 *   won't be filtered out.

 *   `false`, no word-level time offset information is returned. The default is
 *   `false`.
 *

 * `StreamingRecognizeResponse` is the only message returned to the client by
 * `StreamingRecognize`. A series of zero or more `StreamingRecognizeResponse`
 * messages are streamed back to the client. If there is no recognizable
 * audio, and `single_utterance` is set to false, then no messages are streamed
 * back to the client.
 *
 * Here's an example of a series of ten `StreamingRecognizeResponse`s that might
 * be returned while processing audio:
 *
 * 1. results { alternatives { transcript: "tube" } stability: 0.01 }
 *
 * 2. results { alternatives { transcript: "to be a" } stability: 0.01 }
 *
 * 3. results { alternatives { transcript: "to be" } stability: 0.9 }
 *    results { alternatives { transcript: " or not to be" } stability: 0.01 }
 *
 * 4. results { alternatives { transcript: "to be or not to be"
 *                             confidence: 0.92 }
 *              alternatives { transcript: "to bee or not to bee" }
 *              is_final: true }
 *
 * 5. results { alternatives { transcript: " that's" } stability: 0.01 }
 *
 * 6. results { alternatives { transcript: " that is" } stability: 0.9 }
 *    results { alternatives { transcript: " the question" } stability: 0.01 }
 *
 * 7. results { alternatives { transcript: " that is the question"
 *                             confidence: 0.98 }
 *              alternatives { transcript: " that was the question" }
 *              is_final: true }
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * - Only two of the above responses #4 and #7 contain final results; they are
 *   indicated by `is_final: true`. Concatenating these together generates the
 *   full transcript: "to be or not to be that is the question".
 *
 * - The others contain interim `results`. #3 and #6 contain two interim
 *   `results`: the first portion has a high stability and is less likely to
 *   change; the second portion has a low stability and is very likely to
 *   change. A UI designer might choose to show only high stability `results`.
 *
 * - The specific `stability` and `confidence` values shown above are only for
 *   illustrative purposes. Actual values may vary.
 *
 * - In each response, only one of these fields will be set:
 *     `error`,
 *     `speech_event_type`, or
 *     one or more (repeated) `results`.
 *
 * @property {Object} error
